# k-SAT

This repository contains a framework for testing the effectivness of heuristics solving k-SAT problem.

## Algorithms

### Unit Clause (UC)

UC has positive probability of finding a satisfying assignment for r < 8/3 = 2.66

Having n/10 variables left, and getting rid of 3-clauses (randomly choosing vars inside them), then we would be left with random 2-SAT, with less than (3/4)/ (n/10) variables

for k > 3, we get that r <

### Unit Clause with Majority (UCM)

w.p.p satisfying 3-SAT for r < 2.9
